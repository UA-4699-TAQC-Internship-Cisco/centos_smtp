"""This folder holds custom Python libraries that extend Robot Framework's capabilities.
If you need complex logic, integrations with external systems,
or specialized actions not provided by existing Robot Framework libraries,
you'll create your own Python classes here.
Example:
CustomLibrary.py might contain functions for advanced data manipulation or specific API calls."""
