"""Contains configuration files for different environments (e.g., Dev, QA, Staging, Production).
You can use Python files (.py), JSON (.json), or YAML (.yaml)
to store environment-specific variables like URLs,
 credentials (handle securely, avoid hardcoding!), and database connections.
Example:
    environments.py could have a dictionary where keys
    are environment names and values are dictionaries of environment-specific settings.
