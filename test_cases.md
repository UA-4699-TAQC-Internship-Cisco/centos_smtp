This document outlines 40 automation test cases for a hypothetical SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) service. These test cases cover various aspects of email sending, connection handling, authentication, and error scenarios.

### Assumptions for the Service:
* Standard Ports: SMTP (25), SMTPS (465), Submission (587).
* Authentication: Supports common methods like PLAIN, LOGIN.
* TLS/SSL: Supports secure connections over TLS/SSL.
* Error Handling: Returns appropriate SMTP response codes (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx) and descriptive messages.
* Test Environment: A controlled environment where server configurations (e.g., authentication requirements, relaying, user accounts, blacklists) can be manipulated for testing purposes.

## Category 1: Connection and Basic Handshake

1. TC001: Successful Connection to Standard SMTP Port (25)
* Description: Verify a successful connection can be established tothe default SMTP port.
* Steps: Establish a TCP connection tosmtp.example.com on port 25.
* Expected Result: Server responds with a 220 service ready greeting.

2. TC002: Successful Connection toSubmission Port (587) with STARTTLS
* Description: Verify a successful connection and initiation of TLS on the submission port.
* Steps: Establish a TCP connection tosmtp.example.com on port 587, send EHLO, then STARTTLS, and re-negotiate connection over TLS.
* Expected Result: Server responds with 220 after initial connection, 250 after EHLO, and 220 after STARTTLS, followed by successful TLS handshake.

3. TC003: Successful Connection toSMTPS Port (465)
* Description: Verify a successful implicit TLS connection tothe SMTPS port.
* Steps: Establish a TLS-encrypted TCP connection directly tosmtp.example.com on port 465.
* Expected Result: Server responds with a 220 greeting over the encrypted channel.

4. TC004: Connection toInvalid Port
* Description: Verify that connecting toa non-SMTP port results in a connection refusal or timeout.
* Steps: Attempt toestablish a TCP connection tosmtp.example.com on a known unused port (e.g., 9999).
* Expected Result: Connection refused or connection timeout.

5. TC005: Incomplete Connection (Drop Connection After Greeting)
* Description: Verify server behavior when client drops connection after greeting.

* Expected Result: Server logs show connection closed by client; n* errors or resource leaks on the server.

6. TC031: Concurrent Connections (Multiple Simultaneous Valid Connections)
* Description: Verify the SMTP server can handle multiple concurrent, valid client connections without errors or performance degradation.
* Steps: Simultaneously establish 50-100 (or a configurable number) independent TCP connections tothe SMTP server on a standard port (e.g., 25 or 587). Perform a basic EHL* on each.
* Expected Result: All connections are successfully established, and all EHL* commands receive a 250 OK response. Server resources (CPU, memory) remain within acceptable limits.

7. TC032: Connection Rate Limit Exceeded
* Description: Verify the server correctly enforces connection rate limits, if configured, by rejecting excessive connection attempts from a single IP.
* Steps: Rapidly attempt toestablish a very high number of TCP connections (e.g., 500 connections in 10 seconds) from a single source IP address.
* Expected Result: After a certain threshold, subsequent connection attempts are actively refused by the server (e.g., TCP RST) or time out, and the server logs indicate rate limiting.

Category 2: Authentication

26. TC034: Invalid Email Address in DATA Body (e.g., in a From: header)
* Description: Verify that an invalid From: address within the email headers in the DATA stream (not the MAIL FROM command) doesn't cause a server crash or unexpected behavior.
* Steps: Send a valid MAIL FROM and RCPT TO, then in the DATA command, send headers including From: <malformed_address@>.
* Expected Result: Server accepts the mail (as the MAIL FROM was valid), and ideally, the recipient's mail client might show a warning, but the SMTP server itself should not error out.
27. TC035: Missing Dot Termination for DATA (Client drops connection)
* Description: Verify server behavior when the client drops the connection after sending DATA but without sending the . termination.
* Steps: Connect, EHLO, AUTH, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, DATA, send some body content, then immediately close the socket without sending ..
* Expected Result: Server logs show connection closed by client, and the partial email is not delivered. Server should clean up resources and not crash.
28. TC036: Attempt tosend DATA with just a dot on a line (without dot-stuffing)
* Description: Verify the server's handling of a . character at the beginning of a line within the DATA stream without proper dot-stuffing.
* Steps: Send MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, DATA. Send a line like . then another line, without sending ..
* Expected Result: Server should interpret the lone dot as the end of the DATA stream and close the DATA phase, potentially leading toan incomplete message or error if the intent was more data. The server should not crash.
29. TC037: Sender Domain Does Not Exist (DNS Check)
* Description: Verify the server rejects MAIL FROM commands if it performs a reverse DNS lookup or checks for the existence of the sender's domain's MX records, and the domain doesn't exist.

* Expected Result: Server responds with 550 5.7.1 Sender policy rejected or similar error.
37. TC030: Max Line Length in DATA (e.g., 998 characters + CRLF)
* Description: Verify the server correctly handles lines exceeding the maximum recommended length in the DATA stream (excluding the dot-stuffing case).
* Steps: Send an email body containing a single line of text longer than 998 characters (without CRLF until the end).
* Expected Result: Server accepts the email, or rejects with a specific error if it strictly enforces a shorter limit. (Ideally, it should accept per RFC 5321, but some MTAs might have stricter rules).
38. TC038: IP Address Blacklisting (Connection Rejection)
* Description: Verify that the server actively rejects connection attempts from IP addresses listed on its internal or external blacklists (e.g., DNSBLs).
* Steps: Attempt toestablish a TCP connection tothe SMTP server from a known blacklisted IP address (in a test environment).
* Expected Result: Connection is refused immediately, or the server closes the connection shortly after the greeting with a 554 5.7.1 Access denied or similar message, and logs indicate the blacklisted IP.
39. TC039: Header Injection Attempt (CRLF Injection)
* Description: Verify the server's robustness against CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) injection attempts in email headers during the DATA phase.
* Steps: Send valid MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, DATA. In the header section of DATA, attempt toinject extra headers or break existing ones by inserting \r\n characters (e.g., Subject: Test%0D%0AFrom: spoof@example.com).
* Expected Result: The server should sanitize or reject the malformed headers, preventing the injection. The email should either be rejected or delivered with the injected characters escaped, not interpreted as new headers.
40. TC040: Reverse DNS Mismatch (PTR Record Check)
* Description: Verify that the SMTP server rejects incoming connections or mail from clients whose IP address does not have a valid, matching Reverse DNS (PTR) record.
* Steps: Attempt toconnect and send mail from a test client IP address that either has n* PTR record or a PTR record that does not resolve back tothe original IP (misconfigured rDNS).
* Expected Result: The server should respond with a 550 5.7.1 Client host rejected: cannot find your hostname or 450 4.7.1 Client host rejected: cannot find your hostname, depending on the server's policy.
